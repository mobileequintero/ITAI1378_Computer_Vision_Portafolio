Conclusion and Reflection

	Aug 22, we started the first weeks inside  computer vision. In my option the program and methodology was very well developing for instance the first activity was known the tools as Jupyter 
  notebooks, Google Colabs,Github , Python and general basic concepts.In the next weeks, we learned about Compute Vision and History and timeline, 
  additional exploring and processing basics exercises and labs when we advanced in the course the teacher had good performance and domain of topics.

  Other Important things that we learned was the importance use Neural Networks, Why Pixel are important in Compute vision as Size of image, number of layers, 
  Numbers of Neurons or Kind of Neural Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron , CNN. In Other hands, the importance the image dataset as CIFAR10, 
  ImageNet and other importants dataset of industry.

  One important best practice in Compute vision is transfer Learning that use two important approaches one of them is freezing and the second of them is Fine-Tunning.

   Additionally, we learned the importance of Generative AI and the integration with agents. In the classroom, 
   we watching many examples and resources for we have hard skills in compute vision traditional and generative AI.

   Only, I said thank  you  all my classmate and Teacher for spend your time and energy for make a good students.

Regards.
